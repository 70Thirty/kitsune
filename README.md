# Kitsune
Kitsune is a custom user.js that aims for more dialed down parameters compared to other options in order to still have a usable web browsing experience without compromising on too much security.

# Installation
Download the user.js and copy it to your Firefox profile's root directory. This may reset some things so its recommended to create a new profile unless you know what you are doing.
